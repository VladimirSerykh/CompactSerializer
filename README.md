# CompactSerializer
This repository implements compact and fast way of .Net POCO objects serialization for further saving them in a cache. The main idea is to enumerate the same list of type properties during write and read, thus saving and restoring their bytes in the same sequence, without any metadata. Though, according to MSDN, Type.GetProperties() method does not guaranty returning properties in the declaration or alphabetical order, the sequence returned for the same version of the same type stays the same from call to call. Thus, even re-created serializer should restore serialized object correctly. Sure, when the set of object properties is modified, this approach will not work, but as as indicated above, the intended use is to store data in cache. The serialization process includes saving type version, and the easiest way to handle object's source code modification is to just invalidate corresponding key in the cache
The solution uses the capabilities of System.Reflection and System.Reflection.Emit namespaces for properties enumeration and code generation.
